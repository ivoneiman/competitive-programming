# C++ Learning Repository (Bilingual)

Hi! I'm Ivo, and this guide was carefully created by me to help you learn C++, from its basics to more advanced applications, with a special focus on **competitive programming**. The content is available in both **Spanish** and **English**, covering a wide range of topics designed to enhance your understanding of the language and improve your algorithmic skills.

Additionally, as a student at the National University of La Plata, I'm currently deepening my knowledge in these topics, so we will be studying this path together!

## What will you find in this guide?
### 1. Introduction to C++
- History and characteristics of the language.
- Comparison with other programming languages.
- Advantages of learning C++ and its large community.

### 2. Competitive Programming
- Description of what competitive programming is.
- List of important global events:
  - ICPC, IOI, Google Code Jam, IEEEXTREME, among others.
- Popular weekly challenge platforms like Codeforces, LeetCode, and TopCoder.

### 3. C++ Syntax Fundamentals
- Basic structure of a program.
- Explanation of variables, libraries, and control structures.
- Practical examples and exercises.

### 4. Advances in Algorithms and Data Structures
- Popular algorithms in competitive programming.
- Common data structures: arrays, linked lists, trees, and more.

## How is it organized?
Each section is available in both languages, making it easier for both Spanish and English speakers to learn. Each topic includes code examples, clear explanations, and practical challenges to test your knowledge.

## Who is this guide for?
This repository is designed for:
- Beginners who want to learn C++ from scratch.
- Intermediate programmers looking to improve their competitive programming skills.
- People interested in participating in international programming competitions.

## Contributions
This is an open project for contributions. If youâ€™d like to collaborate by fixing mistakes, adding more examples, or suggesting improvements, feel free to make a **pull request**.

## Additional Resources
Throughout the repository, you will find links to external resources such as tutorials, official documentation, and competition platforms. Stay tuned for updates.
