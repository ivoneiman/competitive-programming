# Introduction to C++ and Competitive Programming

## What is C++?
C++ is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world, known for its efficiency, flexibility, and ability to handle large-scale applications. With a massive and active community, there is a wealth of information, resources, and solutions readily available online. This makes learning C++ easier and improves the development experience, making it a great choice for both beginners and advanced professionals.

## Competitive Programming
Competitive programming is a discipline where programmers are challenged to solve algorithmic problems under time and resource constraints. This practice sharpens skills in logic, optimization, and data structure management. There are numerous events and competitions that allow programmers to test their skills against others worldwide.

### Major Events (Annual):
1. **ICPC** - International Collegiate Programming Contest
2. **IOI** - International Olympiad in Informatics
3. **IEEEXTREME Programming Competition**
4. **Google Code Jam**
5. **Hash Code** and **Kick Start** by Google
6. **Hacker Cup** by Facebook

### Frequent Events (Weekly):
- **LeetCode**: Weekly and monthly challenges.
- **TopCoder**: Regular algorithm contests.
- **Codeforces**: Weekly rounds of competitions.
- **AtCoder**: Programming competitions from Japan.
- **HackerEarth**: Code challenges and contests.
- **CodeChef**: Monthly and weekly coding events.

## Basic structure of a C++ program
The syntax of C++ is quite specific and follows a clear structure. Below is the basic skeleton of a C++ program:

```cpp
# include <bits/stdc++.h> // Library that allows invoking many tools
using namespace std;      // Helps save time when writing C++ code

int main(){               // Main function
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); // Program optimization for competitive programming

// The code starts below
    cout << "Hello World"; // Prints Hello World to the console

    return 0; // Part of the main function
}
